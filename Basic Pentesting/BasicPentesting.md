# Basic Pentesting
This CTF contains:
    * brute forcing 
    * hash cracking 
    * service enumeration
    * Linux Enumeration

Starting with a Nmap Scan:<br>
![nmap scan](Images/ports.PNG)<br>

There are several findings. First the Apache Webserver, second the SMB service, and SSH is enabled. <br>

The next Scan will be against the Webserver with gobuster to find hidden directories.<br>
![gobuster scan](Images/gobuster.PNG)<br><br>

Running at the same Time enum4Linux to get Information on the SMB protocol.<br>
![enum4linux](Images/enum4linux.PNG)<br>
The Scan gave two results. Those results are going to be used in a bruteforce attack against ssh with hydra.<br>
The first username came back with no results, but for the second username hydra found credentials.<br>
![hydra](Images/hydra.PNG)<br>
Log into ssh with the credentials and search trough the Files.<br>
![File System](Images/fileSys.PNG)<br>
There is a Folder for the second User 'Kay'. That Folder contains a Password Backup File, and the ssh directory with the private ssh key for Kay. <br>
![id_rsa](Images/id_rsa.PNG)<br>
Open and copy it. Then convert it into a hash File so that John the Ripper can crack it.<br>
![id_rsa_copy](Images/id_rsa_copy.PNG)<br>
Now it can be cracked with John<br>
![Cracked Hash](Images/cracked_hash.PNG)<br>
With the given Password we can log in as Kay. <br>
![SSH Log in](Images/ssh_login.PNG)<br>
Now the Password File can be accessed.
