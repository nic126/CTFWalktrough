Starting with a Nmap Scan:<br>
![nmap scan](Images/ports.PNG)<br>

There are several findings. First the Apache Webserver, second the SMB service, and SSH is enabled. <br>

The next Scan will be against the Webserver with gobuster to find hidden directories.<br>

Running at the same Time enum4Linux to get Information on the SMB protocol.<br>

The Scan gave two results. Those results are going to be used in a bruteforce attack against ssh with hydra.<br>
The first username came back with no results, but for the second username hydra found credentials.<br>
